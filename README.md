# Method
Portfolio display using React framework and the Behance API

Functionality and design are combined to bring you a simple yet powerful portfolio App powered by the Behance API. 

## Available Scripts

Clone to your machine and /cd in

Run the following:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Files not essential to the project must be added to the .gitignore

Never work on or push to main

Create your local version of main `git checkout -b main`

Once you have finished 'milestone' sections of code and components: first push to your remote branch, then switch to main `pull >> merge >> push` then switch back to your branch

Every time you merge to the main branch, let the other team members know.
<br> They MUST switch to the main branch and pull `git checkout main` + `git pull` then switch back

**Merge to main often to keep conflicts resolved**
