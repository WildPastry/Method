## Available Scripts

Clone to your machine and /cd in

`npm install`

### `npm start`

Files not essential to the project must be added to the .gitignore

Never work on or push to the master branch

Create your local version of the master-dev `git checkout -b master-dev`

Once you have finished 'milestone' sections of code and components: first push to your remote branch, then switch to master-dev `pull >> merge >> push` then switch back to your branch

Every time you merge to the master-dev branch, let the other team members know.
<br> They MUST switch to the master-dev branch and pull `git checkout master-dev` + `git pull` then switch back to your branch

**Merge to master-dev often to keep conflicts resolved**
